Q-1012 -> Holes in a Number
You are designing a poster which prints out numbers with a unique style
applied to each of them. The styling is based on the number of closed
paths or holes present in a given number.

The number of holes that each of the digits from 0 to 9 have are equal to
the number of closed paths in the digit. Their values are:
1, 2, 3, 5, and 7 = 0 holes.
0, 4, 6, and 9 = 1 hole.
8 = 2 holes.

Given a number, you must determine the sum of the number of holes for
all of its digits. For example, the number 819 has 3 holes.
